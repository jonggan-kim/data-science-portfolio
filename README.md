# Data Science Portfolio by Tomi Gelo

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms.

# Standalone Projects

## Spotify Cluster Analysis (Work in Progress!)

In this notebook I used unsupervised machine learning algorithms such as K-Means and PCA to discover groups of unlabeled data by clustering and visualizing audio features data collected from the official Spotify Web API.

**Update: notebook files temporarily removed as I'm working on an updated version**

# Kaggle

## Santander Value Prediction (work in progress!)

In my first official Kaggle competition I used the LGBM framework for my [baseline model](https://www.kaggle.com/tomigelo/benchmark-model-with-lgbm-1-48) to get a RMSE score of 1.48 (top 65%). Currently, I'm working on an improved version for my final submission.

I also created [this notebook](https://github.com/tgel0/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/leaderboard.ipynb) where I used jupyter widgets to create an interactive histogram of the public score distributions. 

## Loan dataset

*Fun fact: was is my first notebook ever!*

Using python libraries numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn I performed data exploration and visualization on a dataset from Kaggle which includes loan data.
