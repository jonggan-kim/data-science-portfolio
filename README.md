# Data Science Portfolio by Tomi Gelo

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms.

# Standalone Projects

## Spotify Cluster Analysis (Work in Progress!)

In this notebook I used unsupervised machine learning algorithms such as K-Means and PCA to discover groups of unlabeled data by clustering and visualizing audio features data collected from the official Spotify Web API.

**Update: notebook files temporarily removed as I'm working on an updated version**

# Kaggle

## Santander Value Prediction

In my first official Kaggle competition I used a XGBoost and LightGBM ensemble model which got me a private score of 1.35 (top 40%).
I also created [this notebook](https://github.com/tgel0/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/leaderboard.ipynb) where I used jupyter widgets to create an interactive histogram of the public score distributions.

## Titanic

For the Titanic competition I used extensive feature engineering as well as an AutoML-powered model with [TPOT](https://epistasislab.github.io/tpot/) to score 0.81818. This got me into the top 2% of all submissions.

## Loan Dataset

*Fun fact: this was my first notebook ever!*

Using python libraries numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn I performed data exploration and visualization on a dataset from Kaggle which includes loan data.
