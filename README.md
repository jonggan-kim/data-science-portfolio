# Data Science portfolio by Tomi Gelo

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms.

## Spotify Cluster Analysis

In this notebook I used unsupervised machine learning algorithms such as K-Means and PCA to discover groups of unlabeled data by clustering and visualizing audio features data collected from the official Spotify Web API.

## Simple Exploration Notebook

Using python libraries numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn I performed data exploration and visualization on a dataset from Kaggle which includes loan data.
